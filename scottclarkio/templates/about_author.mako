<h5>About the Author</h5>
<p>I'm <a href="http://scottclark.io" target="_blank">Scott Clark</a>, after a circuitous path through academia I found my way to San Francisco as a software engineer. I currently work at <a href="http://internets.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a> as an ad targeting engineer, using <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAN6iyYPbEE" target="_blank">machine learning</a> and <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/YelpEngineering/yelp-engineering-open-house-112013-optimally-learning-for-fun-and-profit" target="_blank">mathemagics</a> to improve our ad quality. I also work on building and fostering <a href="http://www.yelp.com/academic_dataset" target="_blank">academic collaborations and outreach</a>. If you are looking for a <a href="http://www.yelp.com/careers" target="_blank">career</a> and are interested in the intersection of software engineering and mathematics hit me up at sclark+blogjob@yelp.com.</p>
